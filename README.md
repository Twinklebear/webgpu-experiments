# WebGPU Experiments

Note (8/31/2021): these have fallen a bit out of date with WebGPU API changes coming up to
the final release. I haven't had time to update them yet, but will update this repo when
I've done so.

A series of examples written while learning about [WebGPU](https://gpuweb.github.io/gpuweb/):
a glTF viewer, a web-based LiDAR viewer, and a data-parallel Marching Cubes implementation using compute shaders.
The glTF viewer uses a custom glb importer to load data efficiently into WebGPU and supports
the basic glTF features. The LiDAR viewer uses [LAStools.js](https://github.com/Twinklebear/LAStools.js),
a version of [libLAS](https://github.com/LAStools/LAStools)
compiled to Web Assembly, to load las and laz files directly in the browser.
The Marching Cubes example is a data-parallel implementation of marching cubes
written using compute shaders to leverage GPU compute for interactive isosurface
extraction. If you have a browser with WebGPU enabled, you can try them out:
[glTF Viewer](https://www.willusher.io/webgpu-experiments/glb_viewer.html),
[LiDAR Viewer](https://www.willusher.io/webgpu-experiments/lidar_viewer.html),
[Marching Cubes](https://www.willusher.io/webgpu-experiments/marching_cubes.html).

## Triangle & Generated Triangle

Basic demos of rendering a triangle, or generating one and the draw calls in a compute shader.

## GLB Viewer [Try it out!](https://www.willusher.io/webgpu-experiments/glb_viewer.html)

A binary glTF viewer supporting static scenes with multi-level instancing, different materials, and textures.

## Marching Cubes [Try it out!](https://www.willusher.io/webgpu-experiments/marching_cubes.html)

A data-parallel implementation of Marching Cubes using compute shaders.
Note that as of 5/7/2020 some functionality (3D texture uploads) is not implemented in WebGPU
which would make this easier to implement or include some other features (e.g.,
sampling the volume, adding volume rendering),

## LiDAR Viewer [Try it out!](https://www.willusher.io/webgpu-experiments/lidar_viewer.html)

A viewer for las/laz files. Uses [LASTools.js](https://github.com/Twinklebear/LAStools.js)
to load las/laz files directly in the browser, and renders them as instanced billboard quads.
To run this demo, download the LASTools.js release (liblas.js, liblas.wasm, liblas_wrapper.js)
and place them under `js/`.
